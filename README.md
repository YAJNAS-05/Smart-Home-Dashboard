# Smart Home Dashboard

A simple static Smart Home Dashboard demo built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project provides separate pages for each room and basic navigation to view room-specific controls and information.

## Features

- Room-specific pages: Home, Living Room, Kitchen, Bedroom, Bathroom, Garden
- Simple responsive layout using `style.css`
- Client-side interactivity in `script.js`
- Static assets stored in `Images/`

## Files of Interest

- `home.html` — main dashboard entry page
- `living_room.html`, `kitchen.html`, `bedroom.html`, `bathroom.html`, `garden.html`, `features.html`, `about.html` — room/feature pages
- `login.html`, `signup.html` — auth pages (UI only)
- `style.css` — styles
- `script.js` — client-side scripts
- `Images/` — image assets

## Usage

1. Open `home.html` directly in your browser, or run a local static server from the project root.

PowerShell (Python):

```
python -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000/home.html
```

Or use any static file server (Live Server extension, `serve`, etc.).

## Development

- This is a static front-end demo — no build step required.
- Edit HTML/CSS/JS files and refresh the browser.
